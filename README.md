# Candle pin App - frontend


#### Problem Statement
A fictional candlepin bowling company wants to upgrade their bowling lanes with an automated scoring system. The lanes have been outfitted with cameras and sensors which will feed information about downed pins to an application server. This server should calculate and track game information for each lane. Each lane will have a tablet that displays the game information for all players to see.

#### Setup

```
$ git clone https://github.com/emukungu/Candlepin.git
$ cd Candlepin
$ npm install
```

#### Running the application locally
```
$ npm run start
```

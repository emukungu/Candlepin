# Candlepin Scorekeeper - Interview Exercise

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). The requirements and description for this exercise were added to the `docs` directory for convenience.

Overview:

* Update the LICENSE to either be open source OR to be copyrighted to you. This exercise is solely for us to review your code and skills.
* Create a new repo with this code as the base. There should be two branches: `main` and `devel`.
* Create a branch from `devel` and create the application there.
* Use the test data in `test-data` to test and develop.
* Once done, create a pull request, assign Joseph and Scott to it, and notify us of the code.
